<h1>Experiments on Visual Inference</h1>
<p> Several experiments were conducted to validate and apply visual statistical inferential procedure. Human subjects were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and redirected to these experiment sites for providing evaluation on lineups. The results were published in numerous papers as linked in the description. These experiments were funded in parts by NSF grant DMS 1007697. </p>
