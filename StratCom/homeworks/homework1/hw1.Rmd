1. **Diamond cuts** For this problem we will use diamonds data from ggplot2 package. If you load the package the data set will be available.
    a. Generate a scatter plot of price vs carat
    b. Color the scatter plot by cut
    c. Show smoothed lines using method 'loess'
    d. Facet the plot based on clarity
    e. Now generate a side by side boxplot of price by cut. For which cut does the median price of diamond appear to be the highest?
