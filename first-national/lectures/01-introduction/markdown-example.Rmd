This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Notice the source file extension is `.Rmd`. You can `Knit` this file from `RStudio` and produce the output in either HTML or PDF or MS Word format. Viewing the actual markdown syntax in `.Rmd` file will help you understand how this file is created.

## Basic functions

We use asterisk mark to emphasize the words such as single `*` for *italics* and double `**` for **bolds**.

We use dash mark to create a list.

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3 

We can also create ordered list by numbering them as follows

1. list 1
2. list 2
3. list 3

```
We use back ticks to create
a block of codes
```

## Embedding `R` codes

If we want to embed some `R` codes we can do it as below. This is one of the powers `R` package `kintr` brought for us. We can control the size of the figure in knitr code chunk option. 
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```


We can embed inline `R` codes to display results in a line. Such as the number of records in dataframe women is `r nrow(women)`.

We use function `kable()` to display a table of data
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```

## Math Equation

We can embed mathematical equations. For inline equation we use single `$` sign such as $var(\bar y) =\sigma^2 /n$. For standalone equation we use double `$$` as below
$$f(x) = \frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}e^{-\frac 1 {2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2}$$

## Adding Bibliography
We can add bibliography and cite it. For example if we want to cite `knitr` we just do it as this [^1]. If we want to cite other references we can do it as this[^2].
